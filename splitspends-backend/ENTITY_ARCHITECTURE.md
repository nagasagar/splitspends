## **🎯 Why These Entities Are Essential**

### **✅ Covers All Your Requirements**

1. **"Settle-up calculations"** → `SettleUp` entity
2. **"Activity feed: Who paid what, notifications"** → `ActivityLog` + `Notification` entities  
3. **"Who owes whom and how much"** → `SettleUp` + `ExpenseSplit` entities
4. **"Image upload for receipts"** → `Attachment` entity
5. **"Real-time updates: WebSocket notifications"** → `Notification` entity
6. **Group management** → `Invitation` entity for smooth onboarding

### **✅ Enterprise-Grade Features**

- **Audit Trail**: Every action is logged in `ActivityLog`
- **Notification System**: Comprehensive notification types with priorities
- **File Management**: Professional attachment handling with validation
- **Settlement Workflow**: Complete payment tracking with confirmations
- **Invitation System**: Secure, token-based group invitations

### **✅ Scalability & Performance**

- **Proper Indexing**: All entities have strategic database indexes
- **Lazy Loading**: Relationships use FetchType.LAZY for performance
- **Soft Deletion**: Data preservation with audit capabilities
- **JSON Metadata**: Flexible storage for additional context
